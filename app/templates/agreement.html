                        reason for this is the variation in legislation from council to council, which makes it
                        challenging to determine the necessary application or approval process. Expanders also cannot
                        guarantee compliance with the regulations of any local council area.</P>
                    <p>If you put an Expander on a trailer they are considered as a Caravan (movable dwelling) and can

                      <p>24.1 No waiver by either party of any of its rights under the Contract will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the waiving party.</p>
                      <p>24.2 A waiver of any breach or default under the Contract will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.</p>
              
                      <h3>25. Assignment</h3>
                      <p>25.1 You may not assign your rights or obligations under the Contract without our prior written consent.</p>
                      <p>25.2 We may assign our rights and obligations under the Contract to any third party without your consent, provided that the third party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Contract.</p>
              
                      <h3>26. General</h3>
                      <p>26.1 If any provision of the Contract is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                      <p>26.2 The Contract will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New Zealand.</p>
